Question1: A*
Question2: MDP
Question3: Constraints satisfaction and knowledge representation + 
		   Bayesian and Markov networks


AGENT:
	Acts on an evironment.

TURING MACHINE:
	An abstract machine that operates on a tape of symbols using a table of rules.
	An agent can be modelled as a turing machine where the tape is the environment.

CHURCH-TURING THESIS:
	Anything that can be computed, can be computed by a Turing Machine.

ELIZA EFFECT:
	Humans are inclined to see computers as humans.

HALTING PROBLEM:
	HP(P,D) = (1 if P halts on D, 0 otherwise)
	Where: 
		P = Program
		D = Data
	No Turing Machine can compute HP.

SEMI-SOLVABILITY:
	Can solve for positive part of HP. (Using Universal Turing Machine?)

NON-DETERMINISM:
	A non-deterministic algorithm is one that, for the same input, may exhibit different
	behaviours on different runs.
	A* is a deterministic algorithm.


FRONTIER SEARCH:
	search(Node) :- frontierSearch([Node]).
	
	frontierSearch([Node|_]) :- goal(Node).
	frontierSearch([CurrentNode|RestOfFrontier]) :-
		findall(NextNode, arc(CurrentNode, NextNode), Children),
		addToFrontier(Children, RestOfFrontier, NewFrontier),
		frontierSearch(NewFrontier).


DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH:
	frontierSearch([[[]|_]|_]).
	frontierSearch([CurrentNode|RestOfFrontier], KB) :-
		findall(NextNode, arc(CurrentNode, NextNode), Children),
		append(Children, RestOfFrontier, NewFrontier),
		frontierSearch(NewFrontierm, KB).
	
	More efficient as added to head of list, but can get stuck if goal is shallow.


BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH:
	frontierSearch([[[]|_]|_]).
	frontierSearch([CurrentNode|RestOfFrontier], KB) :-
		findall(NextNode, arc(CurrentNode, NextNode), Children),
		append(RestOfFrontier, Children, NewFrontier),
		frontierSearch(NewFrontierm, KB).

	Inefficient as have to traverse entire linkedlist, but good if goal is shallow.


A* SEARCH:
	f(x) = cost(x) + h(x)
	Frontier = [Head|Tail] where f(Head) < f(∀ Tail)
	
ADMISSIBILITY:
	Returns the minimum cost solution whenever a solution exists.
	A* is admissable
	
	3 conditions are required:
		1. Underestimate: All heuristics are less than the actual cost.
		2. Termination: For some E > 0, every arc costs >= E.
		3. Finite Branching: {n' | arc(n, n')}, n' is finite.


MARKOV DECISION PROCESS (MDP):
	A 5 tuple <S, A, p, r, y> consisting of:
		1. A finite set S of states.
		2. A finite set A of actions.
		3. A function p: S*A*S -> [0,1]
		   p(s,a,s') = prob(s'|s,a)
		4. A function r: S*A*S -> Real Numbers
		   r(s,a,s') = Immediate reward at s' after a is done at s.
		5. A discount factor y ∊ [0,1]

	A policy (Ⲡ) is a mapping from s -> a
	Ⲡ* = the best policy.

	q0(s,a) = ⅀_s' [p(s,a,s')*r(s,a,s')]
	
	qn+1(s,a) = q0(s,a) + ⅀_s' [p(s,a,s')* ymax_a' qn(s',a')]


ABSORBING:
	State is absorbing if p(s,a,s) = 1 for every a
	Will always remain in state s.

SINK:
	State is a sink if it's absorbing and r(s,a,s) = m for all a.
	All actions give the same reward.

S-DETERMINISTIC:
	Action is s-deterministic if p(s,a,s') = 1 for some s'.
	Basically only one possible s' for given s,a.

S-DRAIN:
	Action is an s-drain if: i
		It is s-deterministic, 
		s' is a sink,
		r(s,a,s') = m where m = r(s',a,s') of the sink.

EXPLORATION VS EXPLOITATION:
	Exploration means we want to know more.
	Exploitation means we want to do the best we can.


A* SEARCH:
	Uses both path cost and heuristic values:
		- cost(p) is the cost of path p.
		- h(p) is the estimate of the cost from the end of p to a goal.
		- f(p) = cost(p) + h(p), is the estimate of the cost of the total path from
		  start node to a goal via p.

	Is a mix of lowest-cost-firt and best-first-search:
		- Treats frontier as a priority queue ordered by f(n).
		- Always selects the node on the frontier with the lowest estimated distance from
		  the start to a goal node constrained to go via that node.

ADMISSIBILITY:
	If there is a solution, A* always finds an optimal solution if:
		- Branching factor is finite.
		- Arc costs are bounded above zero.
		- h(n) is an underestimate of the length of the shortest path from n to a goal node.


HORN CLAUSE:
	Either a definite clause or an integrity clause.

DEFINITE CLAUSE:
	Any regular clause (prolog, less cuts) such as r <- a1 V .. V am.

INTEGRITY CLAUSE:
	A clause of the form: false <- a1 V .. V am.
