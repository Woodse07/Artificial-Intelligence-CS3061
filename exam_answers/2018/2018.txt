QUESTION 1:

(a)
add2frontier(Children, Rest, NewFrontier) :- 
	append(Children, Rest, NewFrontier)

(b)
add2frontier(Children, Rest, NewFrontier) :- 
	append(Rest, Children, NewFrontier)

(c)
Should be modified so that the head of the frontier has the lowest cost q-value..
f(x) = cost(x) + h(x)
[Head|Tail].. f(Head) <= f(T) for all values of T âˆŠ Tail
	
	IMPLEMENTATION:
		todo

(d)
Basically means that if there is a solution, A* will always find it, and it will have the
minimal cost value.

(e)
Three conditions are required for A* to be admissible.
	- Branching factor is finite.
	- Arc costs are bounded above zero.
	- h(n) is an underestimate of the length of the shortest path from n to a goal node.

Yes, these conditions do guarantee that A* will terminate, since the arc costs are bounded
above zero.

(f)
BFS is admissible, since it is guaranteed to find optimal solutions provided that any exist.

(g)
No, A* is not admissible under this setup, since branching factor is infinite.
Maybe also because h(n) is not an underestimate of the length of the shortest path from
n to a goal node?

(h)
A* still won't be admissible under this setup since the branching factor is still infinite.
